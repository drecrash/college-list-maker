Describe other transfer credit policies:
The number of credits that count toward a degree will depend on program requirements. If courses
"reside in a department that does not exist at this campus, credit may not be received. Some credits"
may count toward general electives or general education requirements rather than toward the
degree.

"Courses for which IU South Bend does not have a course-to-course equivalency can sometimes betransferred in as undistributed (UNDI) credit. The decision as to how these UNDI credits will fit intoa degree program is made by the school or division in which a student will pursue a degree, but itmay be necessary to submit syllabi and course descriptions in order for a course-to-courseequivalency to be granted."
