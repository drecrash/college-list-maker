"Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.
Awarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.
Financial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid
applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.
Indebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized,
private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent
are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.
Institutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gi
s and tuition funded grants for which the
institution determines the recipient.
Financial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.
Need-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which
a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants,
jobs, and loans).
Need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which
a student must have financial need to qualify.
Need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must
demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gi
s, or merit-based aid from institutional, state,
federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gis and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of
academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based
aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.
Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
1. Non-need institutional grants6. Non-need outside grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers7. Non-need student loans
3. Non-need athletic awards8. Non-need parent loans
4. Non-need federal grants9. Non-need work
5. Non-need state grants
Non-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not
demonstrate financial need to qualify.
Private student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up
to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.
External scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring
with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it
has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.
Work study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in
financial aid awards.
Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates
H1Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the
same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.
•     If the data being reported are final figures for the 2021-2022 academic year (see the next item below),
use the 2021-2022 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
•     Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
•     Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid
column.
•     For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-
need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.",,,,
